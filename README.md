# ESP32-Bluetooth-Page-Turner

This repository demonstrates how to use an ESP32 microcontroller as a Bluetooth receiver to interface with a **Bluetooth Page Turner Remote Control**. The ESP32 can decode commands sent by the remote, enabling control of external systems such as robots or IoT devices.

## Features
- **Bluetooth Pairing:** Seamlessly connect an ESP32 to the Page Turner remote.
- **Command Decoding:** Detect and process button presses from the remote.
- **Robotic Integration:** Translate remote commands into robotic actions like movement or activation.

## Use Case
This setup is ideal for projects that require a simple, wireless control mechanism for robots, tools, or IoT systems. For example:
- Remotely control robot movements or tasks.
- Trigger custom actions in an IoT environment using a Bluetooth remote.

## Hardware Requirements
- [ESP32 Development Board](https://www.espressif.com/en/products/socs/esp32) (Bluetooth receiver).
- [Page Turner Bluetooth Remote Control](https://www.amazon.fr/dp/B0C6KZTHLC?ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_fed_asin_title&th=1&language=en_GB) (Bluetooth emitter).
